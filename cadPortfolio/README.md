# Hartland Robotics Assemblies

This repository contains a collection of mechanical assemblies designed for Hartland Robotics, used both in competition and community outreach.  

All assemblies were modeled in **Autodesk Fusion 360** and exported as **STEP files** for manufacturing and collaboration.  

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

## Turret Assembly
A turret designed to shoot 5–7 inch foam balls in rapid succession toward a 2-foot hexagonal target at variable distances.  

- Robust yet lightweight, with an emphasis on aesthetics  
- Iterated through multiple design revisions  
- Side plates and spars designed for CNC milling  
- Routing base provides 270° of motion (limited by wiring constraints)

## Recyclo Assembly
A public relations robot built to collect aluminum cans at community events.  

- Designed to reuse older parts  
- Focused on reliability and aesthetics  
- Operates on a mecanum wheel drive for omnidirectional movement  
- Face includes two LED panels, a Raspberry Pi camera, and a speaker  
- Base supports an interchangeable plaque for branding

## Recyclo Touch Screen Controller
A wireless controller for the Recyclo robot.  

- Houses numerous electronics: Raspberry Pi, touchscreen, and thumbsticks  
- Ergonomic casing designed for portability and ease of use

## Swerve Module Assembly
A rotational wheel assembly enabling omnidirectional movement when used in sets of four.  

- Weight-reduced design based on a previous version  
- Mounts to the bottom of the robot frame and is easily removable for servicing  
- Two-motor system: one drives the wheel, the other rotates the module  
- Module housed in a custom ball bearing

## Climber
A rotating arm mechanism enabling traversal of angled hanging bars, similar to monkey bars.  

- Designed for reliable, fast climbing  
- Composed of three main components:  
  - Lower support structure (mounts to robot)  
  - Carriage with pneumatic pin and constant-force springs for elevation  
  - Rotating arm with claws that grab and release bars via pneumatics  
- Arm includes gears connected to an encoder for position feedback  
- Pneumatic air tank mounts located on the support structure

## Ingest Assembly
A front-mounted intake for picking up inflatable cubes and rubber cones.  

- Designed to absorb impacts and bounce back to avoid damage  
- Torsion springs keep the intake deployed; a pneumatic-cylinder-and-string system retracts it  
- Drops to a controlled pickup height from the floor  
- Designed under tight space constraints between the frame and overhead arm

## Arm Gear
A large custom gear providing torque to move a 30-inch arm for placing game elements.  

- Optimized pivot point located close to the back of the robot  
- Built from three plates: two housing plates and a central gear plate  
- Driven by a smaller stationary spur gear, causing the large gear and arm to rotate about the pivot  
- Includes weight-reduction holes without compromising structural integrity
