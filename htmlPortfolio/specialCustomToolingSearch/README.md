# Special & Custom Tooling Search System

This project consolidated the companyâ€™s scattered documentation for **special and custom tools**, non-standard tooling used for a limited number of jobs and parts, into a single, organized catalog.  
A searchable interface was then developed to make this catalog easily accessible to workers on the floor.

## Project Goals
- Combine all separate catalogs of special and custom tools into one **centralized Excel sheet**  
- Provide workers with a **searchable HTML-based interface** for quick access  
- Ensure the engineering department can **easily update and maintain** the system  

## Key Contributions
- Built a **searchable HTML system** integrated into the company intranet  
- Enabled searching by **multiple criteria** to support diverse use cases  
- Developed a **PowerShell script** to automatically update the HTML page from the Excel sheet  
- Authored a **Best Practice** documenting system usage and maintenance  

## Data Details
- All part numbers and vendor names in this repository have been replaced with **phony data**, in accordance with internship confidentiality requirements
